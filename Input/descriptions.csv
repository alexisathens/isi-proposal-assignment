1;a complete measure of wealth and wealth inequality;"In the past years, linking micro data to macro aggregates of the system of national accounts (SNA) received a lot of attention. Most efforts focused on
adding distributions of income and consumption to macro aggregates of the
household sector. In this article, we will include the wealth dimension as well. In
measures of wealth inequality, often pension entitlements are not included. In
the Dutch System of National Accounts however, these are the largest asset of
households. These entitlements relate to work-related and voluntary pensions,
but exclude public pensions. Recently, estimates of household pension wealth
are extended with implicit pension wealth. This is the result of ongoing efforts
to make pension systems more comparable over countries. In this article, we will
show the leveling effects of the pension schemes, and compare the new wealth
measures with income inequality in the Netherlands";"In the past years, linking micro data to macro aggregates of the system of national accounts (SNA) received a lot of attention. Most efforts focused on

2;an introduction to inexda metadata schema;"This paper introduces the metadata schema used by the international network
INEXDA to describe granular datasets from different countries. The schema,
agreed on by all members, facilitates a comprehensive inventory of existing
granular datasets conducted in the member institutions. This inventory, in
turn, will foster harmonisation activities between INEXDA members, broaden
metadata sharing and potentially future data sharing between institutions
represented in the network, and pave the way for metadata on publicly
available granular datasets to be shared with external researchers. The INEXDA
metadata schema was developed to be easily adaptable for non-INEXDA
institutions.";"This paper introduces the metadata schema used by the international network

3;birth registration an essential element for the individual and for government;"Birth registration establishes the identity of the individual, is a requirement
for many government services (education, health services, etc.), and provides
data useful for researchers, government and others. The article describes the
importance of birth registration for the individual and others, considers
measures to improve birth registration completene ss in low- and middleincome countries, 
and cites various applications of birth registration data.
The focus of the proposed improvement measures is on reasonable-cost,
sustainable improvements for low-resource countries.";"Birth registration establishes the identity of the individual, is a requirement

4;building and maintaining trust in today s data;"The availability of big data to National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and their
innovative use has created opportunities to enhance the quality of existing
statistical series, often at lower cost; as well as enable new insights into long
standing public policy questions, primarily by combining big data from various
sources, including with Population Census data. The opportunities presented
by big data to NSOs also come with many challenges, particularly at a time
when the public’s trust in the ability of public and private institutions to keep
their data safe is relatively low. This paper briefly discusses the opportunities
of big data in the Australian context and then primarily focuses on the need
for NSOs to build and maintain trust in the current data landscape. Trust in
data use, which is sometimes referred to as “social licence”, is defined and
examined through multiple lenses. A framework for building and maintaining
trust is also presented for use by NSOs. The framework considers a number of
elements, including transparency and communication, engaging with
providers, the role of expert advisors, privacy, and risk management. This
paper concludes with an outline of the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS)
experiences developing this framework and plans to operationalise.";"The availability of big data to National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and their

5;common approaches to capacity development in response to agenda 2030;"The paper focuses on how the Agenda 2030 affects capacity development (CD)
within national statistical systems (NSSs) and how private consultancies can
contribute to this process. Achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development
Agenda and new metrics caused by globalisation require robust and reliable
data at national level. Today, national statistical authorities are expected to
gradually increase the volume and quality of their data and the availability and
comparability of statistics (OECD 2019). Developing new methods and
extending capacity helps to take advantage of new technologies and new data
sources, increase accuracy, reduce costs and cover emerging topics. The use
of administrative data sources is important for the production of official
statistics, in particular for the comparability of statistics required for policy use
(ibid.). Common processes and quality standards are becoming increasingly
important for the production of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and
the creation of interoperability between all statistical producers in a country is
necessary to unify data exchange. The ever-growing availability of data and its
strategic relevance for official statistics require common approaches to
capacity development within an organization, implemented through privatepublic partnerships (PPPs1
). Tailor-made long-term support is important, not
only to improve several technical skills at the same time, but also to develop
soft skills and deal with institutional constraints, where appropriate. This
process can be sensitive as it is based on the willingness of the actors involved
to take responsibility. We must also recognise the strengths and weaknesses
of different partners who can assist and manage these developments, and
adopt delivery models, which maximise efficiency, sustainability and impact.";"The paper focuses on how the Agenda 2030 affects capacity development (CD)

6;data integration of unbalanced social media and survey information via calibration;"We live in an age of unprecedented amounts of information, generated in
every sector, including business, government and health care, delivered at
high speed and available in a wide variety of forms and formats. This data
may come from many different sources, such as social media posts, digital
pictures and videos, cell phone GPS, purchase transaction records and signals
sensors used to gather climate information. This information - high volume,
diverse and fast - is what is called Big Data. Social media are amongst the
most prolific generators of big data and allow billions of people all around the
world to daily interact, post and share contents and give spontaneous
feedback on specific topics. As opposed to traditional media such as
newspapers, books and television, social media is freely accessible, which
means everyone can publish content and control how the information is
generated and shared. Through social media, people express their opinions
and sentiments towards specific topics, products and services. The ability to
harness big data and social media data is an opportunity to obtain more
accurate analyses and to improve decision-making in industry, government
and many other organizations. However, handling big data may be
challenging and proper data integration is a key dimension in achieving high
information quality. We propose a novel approach to data integration that
calibrates online generated big data with interview-based customer survey
data. A common issue of customer surveys is that responses are often overly
positive, making it difficult to identify areas of weaknesses in organizations.
On the other hand, online reviews are often overly negative, hampering an
accurate evaluation of areas of excellence. The proposed methodology
calibrates the levels of unbalanced responses in different data sources via
resampling and performs data integration using Bayesian Networks to
propagate the new re-balanced information. We show, with a case study
example, how the novel data integration approach allows businesses and
organizations to get a bias-corrected appraisal of the level of satisfaction of
their customers. The application is based on the integration of online data of
review blogs and customer satisfaction surveys from the San Francisco airport.
We illustrate how this integration enhances the information quality of the data

7;developing methodology for the register based census in estonia;"The next census in Estonia is planned as a register-based one, all necessary
information will be derived from 25 registers. During the preparation period,
the algorithms for creating census variables from register variables are
prepared and tested, as well as criteria for quality checks are developed. While
working out the methodology for the register-based census it became obvious
that the list of data sources is subject to change. It may require patience to
obtain data from new sources. Even if the source of relevant data is available
and the data holder has agreed to share the data, the process can be timeconsuming.";"The next census in Estonia is planned as a register-based one, all necessary

8;estimation of gross population flows when spds are incomplete;"Gross population flows are made up of population inflows and population
out¬flows in the population stocks between two time points or over a period
of time. Population inflows comprise of immigration and births while
population outflows comprise of emigration and deaths. A Statistical
Population Dataset (SPD) is a dataset that typically contains one record for
each member in the population. The compilation of an SPD is typically the first
step in the compilation of population estimates from microdata. If a traditional
Census based population estimate, the final census dataset can be considered
an SPD. With a register-based population estimate, the SPD is based on the
population register. SPDs can also be compiled directly from administrative
data as in the Irish PECADO (Population Estimates Compiled from
Administrative Data Only) project. When SPDs are complete and assuming
perfect linkage, gross population flows can simply be derived by compar¬ing
the SPDs between two consecutive timepoints or periods. Population
estimates are simply obtained by taking counts from the SPD. If the SPD
contains only undercount and not overcount then the SPD (list A) can be
adjusted using a second list (list B) in a Dual System Estimation (DSE) setup to
obtain population estimates. The PECADO project proposes a system of
population estimates where both lists are compiled from administrative data
sources. Reliable population estimates will provide for reliable estimates of net
population flows but not gross population flows. We review the system of
population estimates in the PECADO project before proposing an extension
of DSE methods for the estimation of gross population flows that relies on the
same lists used to compile population estimates. While not perfect, the
proposed method has the property that as the coverage of the SPDs becomes
complete the bias and variance of the gross population flow estimates goes
to zero. We also consider alternative options and argue against them in favour
of the proposed method. Finally, we present estimates of gross population
flows using the proposed method and compare them to the official estimates.
The practical application in the PECADO project focuses on two consecutive
periods (calendar years) rather than timepoints.";"Gross population flows are made up of population inflows and population

10;fake news and big data an overview of solutions;"Rapid online spread of misinformation like fake news has become one of the
top trends in modern societies. It has kept increasing, affecting elections and
other policy-making processes, skewing public opinion, and diminishing trust
in science. To tackle the problem, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other
companies are now using big data to identify websites that publish fake
information. By applying methods of data science, fake news can be detected
by scoring web pages, flagging sensationalistic words, weighing facts, and
checking website domain names and Alexa rankings to gauge their reputation.
Nevertheless, critical literacy is needed more than ever for reading and
understanding of news, especially in the context of Online Social Networks. In
this paper, we discuss how machine based actions and human based skills may
help in fighting against fake news.";"Rapid online spread of misinformation like fake news has become one of the

12;gender based and intimate partner violence against women in spain;"Gender-based violence (GBV) is one of the most severe forms of Violence
Against Women, especially when it is caused by an intimate partner. In 2013,
the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that more than one in three
women worldwide has experienced physical and/or sexual violence throughout
life. Awareness of this problem by governments and international organizations
has increased in recent years.
This paper aims to analyse the prevalence of IPV against women in Spain
during 2016. Based on data from the 2015 Spanish Macro survey of genderbased violence, which included 10,171 women aged 16 and over, we analyse
five types of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV): sexual, physical, psychological
(controlling behaviours and emotional abuse) and economic violence. First, we
describe the Spanish population as a framework to understand GBV in Spain.
Second, we analyse the sample and we characterize those women who have
suffered IPV. Third, we characterize the aggressors, based on the information
provided by the victims. Finally, we provide the profiles of the women who
have suffered from IPV as well as their aggressors. The key findings of this
paper are striking: 13.2% of Spanish women aged 16 or more have suffered
from GBV; only 2.7% have suffered sexual and/or physical violence, but 9.2%
have felt fear or have been controlled. The perception about their own health
is worse amongst women who have suffered from IPV.";"Gender-based violence (GBV) is one of the most severe forms of Violence

13;granger causality in yield curves of different markets;"We develop time series analysis of functional data observed discretely,
treating the whole curve as a random realization from a distribution on
functions that evolve over time. The method consists of principal components
analysis of functional data and subsequently modeling the principal
component scores as vector ARMA process. We justify the method by showing
that an underlying ARMAH structure of the curves leads to a VARMA structure
on the principal component scores. We derive asymptotic properties of the
estimators, fits and forecast. For term structures of interest rates, this provides
a unified framework for studying the time and maturity components of interest
rates under one set-up with few parametric assumptions. We apply the
method to the yield curves of USA and India. We compare our forecasts to the
parametric model of Diebold and Li (2006). We then use the method of
Granger causality on the VARMA of Principal components scores for the two
markets to test if one market drives the other.";"We develop time series analysis of functional data observed discretely,

15;how to measure shelters and specialized services to support to victims of violence;"The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence
against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention, 2011) requires
Countries to provide for setting up ""specialized services of immediate
support, in the short and long term, for each victim of any act of violence that
falls within the scope of the Convention"". The types of support that these
services provide are shelters and safe accommodations, telephone helplines,
sexual violence services, legal support, counselling centres, and specific
services for children as victims or witnesses. For long time in Italy the available
information on this kind of services was fragmented, based only on partial
investigations. The national Agreements between Government, Regions and
Autonomous Provinces (signed in 2014) established the minimum
requirements of anti-violence centres and shelter houses to guarantee
homogeneous criteria at national level and supported the implementation of
a more systematic and extensive data collection. In 2018 Istat carried out for
the first time, in collaboration with the Department for Equal Opportunities
(DPO) at the Presidency of the Council, the Regions and the National Research
Council (Cnr - Irrps), a national survey on the services provided by the antiviolence centres for victims of violence. The survey aims to identify the
different territorial models adopted by the centres describing the dissimilar
opportunities available to support and accompany women and their children
to go through the specific and individual path of exit from violence. The survey
was carried out between June and July 2018, 281 anti-violence centres
meeting the requirements of the 2014 Agreement were interviewed. The
centres mainly provide listening and reception services, legal support,
guidance and support for other services, psychological support, help in
moving away from the violent partner, work orientation, support for
autonomy. In some cases the service is provided directly from the centre, in
others, from the centre in collaboration with the services in the area, in others,
the centre performs an addressing function. This paper presents the results of
a multivariate statistical analysis that took into consideration, on the one hand,
the services provide to women, on the other, the organizational strategies
adopted to respond to users' needs. The statistical analysis was carried out in
two steps: a correspondence analysis and after a cluster analysis that have 
identified six clusters of anti-violence centres corresponding to six different
organizational models.";"The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence

guidance and support for other services, psychological support, help in
moving away from the violent partner, work orientation, support for
autonomy. In some cases the service is provided directly from the centre, in
others, from the centre in collaboration with the services in the area, in others,
the centre performs an addressing function. This paper presents the results of
a multivariate statistical analysis that took into consideration, on the one hand,
the services provide to women, on the other, the organizational strategies
adopted to respond to users' needs. The statistical analysis was carried out in
two steps: a correspondence analysis and after a cluster analysis that have

that Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) do not establish a single but instead a
network of interrelated resident entities, characterized by complex ownership
chains, to channel funds through Luxembourg. Some of these entities issue
debt securities on behalf of the group, and most only have loans and equity

18;inclusive growth does economic growth benefit all;"Government policy is very much driven by economic growth. Almost
unconditionally, hardly giving any consideration to which population groups
capture the gains from the additional income generated, growth of GDP is
considered as the primary policy target. However, especially in developed
economies, trends in recent decades, possibly reinforced by globalisation and
digitalisation, have shown declining shares of compensation of employees,
increasing inequalities in income and wealth, and median incomes hardly
improving. Not only the resulting political tensions, but also the growing focus
on trying to capture (material) well-being, have led to an increased policy
attention for arriving at inclusive growth, i.e. economic growth that benefits
the whole population and not only a happy few.
As a consequence of the above, user demands for data which link
distributional information to macro¬economic statistics has increased
tremendously. A problem in this respect is that data on the micro-level which
describe income, consumption and wealth at the level of households and
individuals, show, sometime quite significant, inconsistencies with data for
similar indicators at the macro-level as can be derived from the system of
national accounts. This hampers policy analysis and related advice.
This paper describes the work that has been done in the context of the OECDEurostat Expert Group on Disparities within National Accounts (EG DNA). The
main objective of this group is to arrive at a consistent set of data on the

19;income consumption and wealth data integration a household perspective;"Disparities in income, consumption and wealth (ICW) are increasingly
analysed, not only by the research community and international organisations

wealth data provides links between the three economic dimensions. These
data help to describe more thoroughly material well-being and households'
economic vulnerability. Income and consumption aggregates drawn from
national accounts (macro-level data) describe the situation of households as
an institutional unit in the macroeconomic context. Income distribution (from
the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, EU-SILC) and
consumption data (from the Household Budget Survey), on the other hand,
are based on micro-level data and used to measure inequalities in the context
of social policies. Eurostat has been working on the two work streams of the
ICW project: The joint distribution of ICW (based on household surveys) and
micro (survey statistics) –macro (national account) data links for households'
ICW. Differing concepts and data collection practices mean that the analysis
of these different sources do not necessarily lead to the same conclusions as

24;measurement of wealth inequality with distributional financial accounts indicators;"In view of the potential role that distributional data can play in explaining
macroeconomic developments, the European System of Central Banks’
Statistics Committee established an Expert Group on Linking Macro and Micro
Data for the Household Sector (EG-LMM) in December 2015. The aim of this
group is to understand, quantify and explain the main differences between the
Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) and the Financial
Accounts (FA). The systematic comparison of the two sources distinguishes
between two main explanatory factors: generic differences, which potentially
affect all or various components of wealth, and detailed instrument-specific
differences in definitions and data collection. Ultimately, the EG-LMM aims to
develop Distributional Financial Accounts (DFA) indicators.
The EG-LMM reported its provisional results in the first half of 2019 and this
paper summarises the outcome. As a first step, this paper briefly describes the
most important conceptual differences between micro and macro data on
household wealth. Compared to pure survey data, DFA indicators provide
information on household wealth that is coherent with macro aggregates.
Inequality indicators between these two sources may differ, since the coverage
of survey data is different for various kinds of assets and across various
household groups. The aim of the group was to improve the comparability
and DFA indicators also in long run. Therefore, it has provided number of
issues, which need to be further worked in the medium-term. In the last part

collection, data sharing and dissemination of microdata. Over the last years
Banco de Mexico has: i) taken the task of a “Trade Repository Like” for
derivative operations with new collection templates and new improvements
on the quality of data and services; ii) implemented a new data sharing
framework with other financial authorities, and new MoUs have been signed;
iii) continued the revision and expansion of metadata as an undergoing
process for improving the use of these microdata bases; and, iv) designed and
developed a new dissemination portal for microdata."

information of all kinds are readily available at our finger tips. All these digital
fragments can be informative or misleading. It is simply not possible to
understand and/or defend a data point when it stands on its own; it requires
a context and a purpose to become a meaningful piece of information. In this
data day and age, contexts, purposes as well as tools, technology and methods
are overwhelmingly abundant. However, how does one know which are the
most appropriate for their purpose? While National Statistical Offices (NSO)
might have been lighthouses whose beacon people readily followed, they now
have to explain and justify themselves for constituents to see the value of the
information they emit. It is the responsibility of the NSO to be able to not only
produce quality data, but also to enable potential users to understand what it
produces. This article will use the example and values of the Methodology

32;special purpose entities and pass through equity a micro analysis with bea data;"Special purpose entities (SPEs), legal entities with little or no employment or
physical presence, play an important role in the global financial system.
Financial transactions and direct investment positions recorded in
macroeconomic statistics often reflect the flow of funds between business
enterprises resident in one country and affiliated SPEs resident elsewhere.
These statistics tend to record large direct investment equity positions in
countries that host relatively more SPEs, irrespective of whether the equity
passes through those countries to be used for production in other countries.
Using firm-level survey data collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA), this paper provides a summary of BEA’s efforts to (i) identify SPEs in U.S.
international economic statistics, (ii) measure the value of pass-through equity
in affiliates, and (iii) understand the relationship between SPEs and passthrough equity. 
Preliminary results show that SPEs play a much larger role in
U.S. direct investment abroad than in foreign direct investment in the United

35;the costs of gender based violence against women in spain;"Violence against women (VAW) is one of the most severe forms of gender
inequality. In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that one
out of three women in the world has experienced physical and/or sexual
violence throughout life. VAW causes thousands of deaths every year, and
millions of victims who experience suffering and pain. Moreover, it has also
significant economic costs in terms of expenditures on service provision and
healthcare, lost income for women and their families, work absenteeism of
victims and aggressors, police and legal costs, etc. This paper aims to estimate
the global costs of VAW caused by intimate partner violence (IPV) in Spain
during 2016. First, it starts describing the methodological aspects needed for
the estimation of costs. Second, we depict the data on victims from the 2015
Spanish Macro survey of gender-based violence. Third, we classify the diverse
impacts of IPV against women in three cost-assessment categories:
employment, healthcare and legal sector. Finally, we estimate the tangible
costs for each one of these categories, as well as for other concepts such as
accommodation needs or other activities of third sector organizations. The
main findings of this paper are that 2.7% of women aged 16 or more have
suffered from physical and/or sexual violence from their intimate partners in
Spain. However, this percentage increases up to 13.2% if we consider other types
of intimate partner violence. Using the accounting model and different
approaches for every category, we estimate the total tangible cost of VAW in
Spain in 2016 between 1,281.0 and 8,540.9 million €, which represent between
0.11% and 0.76% of Spanish GDP.";"Violence against women (VAW) is one of the most severe forms of gender

system on Violence against women (VAW) with the aim to support
stakeholders in designing policies to prevent and combat VAW. The Council
of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women
and domestic violence (2011), the so called Istanbul Convention , ratified in
Italy in 2013, requires States to offer a holistic response to violence against
women, through the “4 Ps approach”: Prevention of violence through
sustained measures that address its root causes and aim at changing attitudes,
gender roles and stereotypes that make violence against women acceptable;
Protecting women and girls who are known to be at risk and setting up
specialist support services for victims and their children; Prosecuting the
perpetrators; adopting and implementing state?wide integrated Policies that
are effective, co-ordinated and comprehensive. Furthermore, based on article
11 “Data collection and research”, the Convention recognizes for the first time
the crucial importance and the role played by statistics in improving the
awareness of gender based violence and its monitoring. With the aim to
respond to the arisen needs the Italian integrated system was built up. It is a

following fields:
1. the prevention and more specifically data on the gender stereotypes and
stereotypes towards violence against women, that are collected among the
adult population and the student population, respectively using computer

INEGI, since every day the computer updates the classification of about
100,000 tweets with information up to the previous day. The system, freely
available on the Internet, allows consulting at national and regional level in
annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily and even hourly series. Also, it is
possible to see the hashtags that dominated the scene and directly access
news sites that help to associate the variations in the series with specific
events. With a series of time that begins in 2016, the system shows dynamics

census in 2011 was prepared under the restrictions of a judgment of the
German constitutional court that preceded the census in 1987 and imposed
strict data protection rules. Still under the impression of the public debate in
1987, in 2011 a combined census model was launched integrating elements

to Greece, since its merchant fleet has a strategic role in the transportation of
the trade and energy of many regions in the world. The statistical framework
presented in the current study, can well be applied by other countries for
Balance of Payments purposes, as well as by researchers and analysts seeking
to estimate revenues and expenses related to shipping activity.
In the Greek Shipping Estimation model a granular level approach is used, with
vessel by vessel characterization. A three-stage approach is taken. Firstly, the
cluster is defined, the main counterparts and the types of Balance of Payments
(BOP) transactions that take place and can be estimated. Secondly, the
population is defined, including legal owner companies, operator/shipmanager companies and the vessels to be included in the registry. Finally, all
BOP transactions for a particular vessel are estimated on a monthly basis.
The maritime cluster structure is discussed, along with guidelines on how to
define the resident population on basis of the economic ownership principle.
A detailed statistical framework to estimate all shipping related transactions is
presented, including vesselsí revenues, bunkers costs, port expenses, manning
costs, administrative costs and other BOP items. For this purpose a series of
international databases is used including among others Lloydís List
intelligence, IHS Maritime and Trade, Clarksons Shipping Intelligence Network
and Drewry.";"The Greek Shipping Estimation Model aims to provide a coherent statistical
framework to estimate Balance of Payments items related to shipping activity,
based on administrative sources and commercial databases.
